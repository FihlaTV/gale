This README file is designed to help the user in how to run the document creation script,
createDocs.py and related scripts.
**********************************

Running through scons:
----------------------
This is the desired way to run the script, and they have been designed to run best through this method.
To run, go to the base stgUnderworld directory and type 

'scons doc'

All the defaults have been setup to run through this method. Running this way, the script will create a directory calle 'doc' in the base directory. In this directory will be 2 sub-directories. These will be 'Codex' and 'Doxygen/html/' In each of these subdirectories will be a number of html files. The files to load are called 'index.html' eg. 'stgUnderworldE/Codex/index.html' Load these to access the created documents.

createDocs.py : 
---------------
This file is designed to be run with scons doc.
It will not work properly run by iteself, as it has a number of default values specified.
Try running 'scons doc' from the stgUnderworld ( or equiv.) directory.
To get a help message, type 'createDocs.py -h'

To run with input options: 
./createDocs.py METATYPE WEBPAGES EMAIL DOXYGENCONFIG

createHTMLDocuments.py:
-----------------------
