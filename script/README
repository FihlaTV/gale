This README file is designed to help the user in how to run the document creation script,
createDocs.py and related scripts.
**********************************

Running through scons:
----------------------
This is the desired way to run the script, and they have been designed to run best through this method.

To run, first follow the configure instructions for StGermain/Underworld project, then go to the base stgUnderworld directory and type 

'scons doc'

All the defaults have been setup to run through this method. Running this way, the script will create a directory called 'doc' in the base directory. In this directory will be 2 sub-directories. These will be 'Codex' and 'Doxygen/html/' In each of these subdirectories will be a number of html files. The files to load are called 'index.html' eg. 'stgUnderworldE/Codex/index.html' Load these to access the created documents.

createDocs.py : 
---------------
This file is designed to be run with scons doc.
It will not work properly run by iteself, as it has a number of default values specified.
Try running 'scons doc' from the stgUnderworld ( or equiv.) directory.
To get a help message, type 'createDocs.py -h'

To run with input options: 
./createDocs.py METATYPE WEBPAGES EMAIL DOXYGENCONFIG

Defaults:
METATYPE: 'dtd' or 'xsd'
WEBPAGES: [['http://www.underworldproject.org','Underworld Home Page']]
EMAIL: 'underworld-users@vpac.org'
DOXYGENCONFIG: Doxyfile

createHTMLDocuments.py:
-----------------------
This is the standalone python script to create the Component Codex web pages. To get help on the input options needed to run this file,
type 'createHTMLDocuments.py -h' which will give a list of the available options and their default values.

createDoxygen.py:
-----------------
This is a standalone python script to be run from this directory.
it creates just the Doxygen web pages. Type 'createDoxygen.py -h' for a list of available options.


createCodex.py:
---------------
This is a standalone python script to be run from this directory. It creates the codex with the same default settings as createDocs.py. It is designed to be a quick way of creating the default codex without creating the Doxygen package as well. Type 'createCodex.py -h' for a list of available options. It is not as flexible as createHTMLDocuments.py for creating the codex.

createDocument.py:
------------------
This is a class for document creation, with createHTMLDocuments.py being a child of this class. It cannot be run by iteself.


Stg*.py and util.py:
--------
These are parsing scripts for meta files and scripts needed to accomplish this end.


headerfilter.py:
----------------
This is the python script used by Doxygen to make Stgermain/Underworld *.h header files readable by Doxygen. It enables classes, TODO's and meta file information to be included in the html output files.
