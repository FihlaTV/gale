README for the convergence tester.

To run convergence tests:

	./runAndTestConvergence.pl <xmlFile> [ OPTIONS ]

where OPTIONS:
	-optionsFile <fileName>		: where <fileName> is the option file. By default serial runs of resolution 16sq, 32sq, 64sq, 124sq are done.
	-againstExpected					: will check the generated numbers against a file in the 'expected' dir. By default check will not occur

EXAMPLE:
	./runAndTestConvergence.pl testVelicSolS.xml -optionsFile OFile.dat 
			Runs with option file OFile.dat and NO check against the expected file.  

These scripts measure the convergence rates in numerical fields generated in Underworld against analytic solutions supplied by Mirko Velic.
The error of FEM fields should decrease with higher resolution - depending on the choice of element type that represents a given field.
These scripts run error measures on given field at several resolutions and then process how the error converges.

The optionsFile can be used to set how each run of the analytic problem differs from the next, see the OFile.dat for details.
