2.1.0
----------------------------------

* The temperature mesh has been changed to be the same as the velocity
  mesh.  This fixes problems when running thermal problems with
  distorting meshes.

* Documentation has been added for modeling density and expansivity
  changes as an arbitrary function of pressure and/or temperature.  This
  is a simple way of modeling phase transitions.

* You may now specify a moving static side.  This is useful when
  modeling a moving wall boundary that only covers part of the
  boundary.

2.0.0
----------------------------------

* The main feature of this release is the support for Quadratic (Q2)
  and discontinuous linear (P-1) elements.

* JSON is the new recommended format for input files.  It works by
  converting the JSON files to XML, so existing XML files will
  continue to work with minor changes.  See the file UPGRADE for
  details.

* Gale now includes an equation parser, allowing you to input initial
  conditions, boundary conditions, and shapes much more easily.  As a
  consequence, the existing StandardConditionFunctions and most shapes
  are no longer recommended, though they will continue to work as
  before.

* StressBC now explicitly applies either a shear or normal stress.
  This also fixed a bug when applying a StressBC against a curved
  boundary.

* Thermal diffusion and advection benchmarks have been added.  These
  benchmarks highlighted bugs with thermal evolution which have been
  fixed.

* VTKOutput has been deprecated.  Instead, you should use the XDMF
  files, which work in Paraview and Visit.

* The File input method for initial conditions and boundary conditions
  can now handle 2D and 3D input data.

* Documentation for tracer particles has been added.

* A bug preventing input from multiple File's and a bug from opening
  too many files were fixed.

* The binaries now ship with checkpointing support.

* Gale is little quieter when checkpointing is turned on.

* A C++ compiler is now required to build.

* The recommended visualization tool has been changed to Visit.

* The generate_pvd utility has been removed.  Visit will automatically
  create a movie from a series of XDMF files.

* The vtk2csv.py script has been removed since it does not work with
  the XDMF files.


1.6.1
----------------------------------

* This release fixes a serious bug where the thermal diffusivities of
  different materials were being ignored in versions since 1.5.0.

* A bug preventing the use of StandardConditionFunctions in StressBC's
  have been fixed.

1.6.0
----------------------------------

* Then meaning of the 'A' parameter in NonNewtonian has changed to
  match what is commonly seen in the literature.  See UPGRADE for more
  details.

* There is a new family of StandardConditionFunction's named
  File1,...,File10 that allow you to read in a function from a file.

* HydrostaticTerm now has a maximum temperature, useful if you are
  incorporating the asthenosphere in your simulations.

* topo_data now works in 2D

* StressBC's can now handle having a different material underneath the
  computational region.

1.5.0
----------------------------------

* The input file format has changed.  See UPGRADE for how to upgrade
  your input files.

* The code from Underworld has been merged in and Gale now uses
  Underworld's build system.

* Checkpoint and restart works.

* Multigrid is available as an optional solver.

* The bottom of the mesh can now be deformed. 

* There is a new script to convert VTK files to CSV (comma separated
  values), which can be easily read by a number of programs.

* There is a new program to generate VTK movie files.

* A new example of a dike was added, and the tibet models removed.

* The Drucker-Prager rheology now has two parameters,
  minimumViscosity and maxStrainRate, which greatly improve the
  robustness and speed.

* The NonNewtonian rheology now has a melting temperature, above which
  the viscosity is constant and independent of strain.

* Inflow boundary conditions work a little better.

* StrainWeakening now takes a shape strainLimitedShape and a parameter
  strainLimit.

* HRS_Erosion, a new surface process, has been added.

* A number of StandardConditionFunctions have been added.

1.4.1
----------------------------------

* A bug that only shows up in 3D parallel runs with a free surface has
  been fixed.

* A bug in how stress boundary conditions are computed with
  hydrostatic terms has been fixed.

* The TemperatureProfile Standard condition function now allows
  variations of the temperature in the x-direction.

* NonNewtonian, a power law creep rheology, has been cleaned up,
  tested, and documented.

The current goals are:

  * Merge Gale back with the VPAC code.  This should give Gale multigrid
    solvers, restart capability, and improved PETSc compatibility.
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Interface with custom surface process models in parallel
  * User-specified non-uniform mesh spacing.

1.4.0
----------------------------------

* Gale now uses linear pressure elements.  This solves a number of
  problems with stability and robustness, and makes the code much
  faster to boot.  Constant pressure elements are no longer supported,
  and the accompanying NodalPressure variables will no longer work.
  This will require modifying your input files.  See the file UPGRADE
  for step-by-step instructions.

* The Mohr-Coulomb rheology has been removed.  Please use
  Drucker-Prager instead.  Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager are the
  same in 2D, and Mohr-Coulomb never really worked in 3D.

* VTK Output now occurs after a Stokes solve, but before any advection
  or strain integration.

* Drucker-Prager can optionally implement a frictional boundary layer.

* The output of the current time and timestep has been clarified.

* The Paraview examples have been updated to version 3.4.0.

* The documentation details how to modify Standard Condition
  Functions.

* Results for the Geomod 2008 benchmarks are in the manual.

* Divergent flow has been added, along with one example and a
  benchmark test case.

* The yielding fraction in the particle vtk output has been replaced
  by the post failure strain.  The yielding fraction can be derived
  from the post failure strain, but not vice-versa.

* There is a new field in the particle vtk output,
  "Currently_Yielding", which is 0 or 1 depending on whether the
  material is yielding on that time step.

* Erf and Erfc have been added as Standard Condition Functions, and
  AnalyticalTemperatureIC now works with Windows 32 bit.

* A bug in how rotation is applied to shapes has been fixed.

* The StepFunction Standard Condition Function now works in time or
  space.

* The TemperatureProfile Standard Condition Function is now documented.

* EulerDeform is now more flexible in specifying how the boundary
  moves.

* The DumpSwarm output method has been removed.  It was a maintenance
  burden, and all of the information is available through the VTK
  files.  This also means that it is no longer possible to visualize
  the results with a spreadsheet like Excel.

* The documentation has been updated to use Paraview 3.4.0.

The current goals are:

  * Merge Gale back with the VPAC code.  This should give Gale multigrid
    solvers, restart capability, and improved PETSc compatibility.
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Interface with custom surface process models in parallel
  * User-specified non-uniform mesh spacing.

1.3.0
----------------------------------

* Nodal pressures have been introduced, eliminating the even-odd
  instability seen in the regular pressure solution.  These pressures
  are now used for calculating yielding and friction.  This will
  require anyone using those features to make some minor changes to their
  input files (see the file MIGRATION for details).
* Results for all of the Geomod 2004 benchmarks are now included and
  described in the manual.
* The vtk output for particles now includes a material index, making
  it easy to distinguish between materials with the same properties
  for visualization.
* Fixing internal degrees of freedom with ShapeVC's is now better
  documented in the manual, including tips on how to use them for
  boundary conditions.
* It is now possible to specify both the upper and lower values for
  StepFunction.
* A bug has been fixed in the diffusion example for surface processes.
* Some bugs in the static and kinetic friction boundary conditions
  have been fixed, and they are now thoroughly tested and benchmarked.
* A minor bug in the Mohr Coulomb yielding model has been fixed.  It
  has also been made more robust and now works with stiff materials.
* A number of memory bugs have been fixed.

The current goals are:

  * Merge Gale back with the VPAC code.  This should give Gale multigrid
    solvers, restart capability, and improved PETSc compatibility.
  * Better normal stress boundary conditions
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Interface with custom surface process models in parallel
  * Implement the Geomod 2008 benchmarks

1.2.2
----------------------------------
* Several high precision benchmarks have been incorporated as tests for Gale.
* The vtk output plugin now uses the parallel xml format, easing
  visualization of runs with large numbers of processors.
* The ordering of tensor values in the vtk output has been fixed.
* There is a rough implementation of static and kinetic friction boundary
  conditions.
* The location of the input files has been reorganized.
* StrainWeakening now takes an initialSofteningStrain and
  FinalSofteningStrain.  Previously, initialSofteningStrain was hard
  coded to be zero and "finalSofteningStrain" was just
  "softeningStrain".  Using the old name "softeningStrain" will still
  work.

The current goals are to work on

  * Cleanup friction boundary conditions
  * Better normal stress boundary conditions
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Interface with custom surface process models in parallel

1.2.1
----------------------------------
* Thermal problems are now documented, including a cookbook example.
* Normal stress boundaries which simulate the effect of a supporting
  material now work and are documented.
* Interfacing with custom surface process models works in serial.
* You may now affect the time step chosen by Gale with the parameter dtFactor.
* There is now a ShearZ function in the list of Standard Condition Functions.
* A bug that prevented the windows binary from working has been fixed.
* A bug in stress boundary conditions which caused applied stresses to
  be too large by a factor of 2 or 4 has been fixed.
* A bug where Gale would run out of memory if reading large input
  files has been fixed.
* Gale is known to work, although not necessarily scale, up to 512 processors.

The current goals are to work on

  * Frictional boundary conditions
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Interface with custom surface process models in parallel

1.2.0
----------------------------------
* Gale has been shown to scale to at least 128 processors
* The VTKOutput and DumpSwarm output plugins work in parallel.
* Gale defaults to installing in the current directory.  So the
  binary is in bin/Gale
* The --with-petsc-arch and --with-libxml-libdir options work
* The windows binary may not work completely with all of the sample
  input files.

While this release should be useful to many researchers, we continue
to work on

  * Isostasy
  * Interface with custom surface process models
  * Deformed lower boundaries
  * Frictional boundary conditions
  * More documentation on thermal problems

1.1.1
----------------------------------
This latest release features a number of bug fixes and improved
documentation.

1.1.0
----------------------------------
   * Gale is known to work in parallel with two processors
   * A bug preventing 3D runs on some machines was fixed.
   * A memory leak preventing long runs was fixed.
   * The documentation has been significantly improved, with eight
     cookbook examples with supporting diagrams added.
   * The subduction example is more realistic.
   * There are a number of Matlab visualization scripts generously
     donated by Boris Kaus
   * We now have binaries for 32 bit x86 Linux, 64 bit AMD Linux,
     32 bit Windows, PPC Mac, and Intel Mac.

While this release should be useful to many researchers, we continue
to work on

  * Interfacing custom surface process models

    little flaky.

  * Parallel works better, but is still a bit flaky

  * Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

  * There is now an example of relaxation of topography.

  * The documentation has been significantly improved.

While this release should be useful to many researchers, we continue
development.  Specifically, we will be working on

  * Interfacing custom surface process models
  * Frictional boundary conditions
  * Deformed lower boundaries


0.9.0
----------------------------------
  * There are now examples of extension, shortening, and subduction
    that work in 2D and 3D.

  * Inflow and outflow boundaries are now supported.

  * A straightforward Mohr-Coulomb yielding model is now available.

  * Parallel is a bit flaky and may or may not work for you.

  * Narrow faults may have numerical problems

  * Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

This release is almost feature complete.  At this point, the only
significant steps from here to 1.0 are

  * Stress Boundaries
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes
  * Improved documentation
  * More thorough testing

0.2.0
----------------------------------
  * The simple-extension.xml example should work in 2D and 3D.  The
    other input files have not been tested.

  * Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

  * Documentation has been improved, though there is still much work
    to do.

  * The parallel capabilities of the code are temporarily broken.

This is a beta release, so do not be surprised if you find bugs.

0.1.0
----------------------------------
This is an alpha release, so it is mostly of interest to developers.
While the installation has been tested on a number of different
machines, if you have an odd machine that you want supported, then it
would be useful if you could try installing Gale now.  Otherwise, if
you just want to run the code, it may be better to wait for a stable
release.
