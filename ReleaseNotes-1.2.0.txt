Release Notes Underworld-1.2:

Engineering
Full migration to new build system, scons. Existing system Vmake is no longer supported. (see http://www.underworldproject.org/documentation/CompileSCons.html for details )
Full migration to new repository system, mercurial. Existing system svn is no longer supported for future releases.
Numerics
Stable checkpointing functionality: bug fixes in parallel behaviour of I/O routines. By default checkpointing now stores only essential information for restarting a problem, unlike it's previous algorithm which stored every field, mesh and swarm in the problem.
PETSc compatibility layer has been deleted, now code call PETSc functions directly
Project “Toolboxes” are now how codes build upon StGermain register their functionality to the executable.
New meshing capabilities.  Can bunch rows and columns of nodes closer together in meshes with regular topology, subject to minor restrictions.
Improvements to mesh deformation methods.  Boundaries can be forced to remain in their initial configuration on a per-dimension basis.
Implementation of analytical solutions located at stgUnderworld/Underworld/SysTest/PerformanceTests/
